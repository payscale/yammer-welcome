Yammer Welcome Screen
=====================
For PayScale HackDay v0.9, JohnL and I wanted something that we could put up in the lobby
of our office. After running through a few ideas, we decided that a "meet the team" screen
was a project we felt like we could finish in a day, and would be a great addition to the
lobby.
